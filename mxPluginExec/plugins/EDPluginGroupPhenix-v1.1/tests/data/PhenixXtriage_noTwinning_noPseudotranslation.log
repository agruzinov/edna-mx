Completeness and data strength analyses

  The following table lists the completeness in various resolution
  ranges, after applying a I/sigI cut. Miller indices for which
  individual I/sigI values are larger than the value specified in
  the top row of the table, are retained, while other intensities
  are discarded. The resulting completeness profiles are an indication
  of the strength of the data.

----------------    Anisotropy analyses     ----------------

Anisotropy    ( [MaxAnisoB-MinAnisoB]/[MaxAnisoB] ) :  2.783e-01
                          Anisotropic ratio p-value :  0.000e+00

     The p-value is a measure of the severity of anisotropy as observed in the PDB.
     The p-value of 0.000e+00 indicates that roughly 100.0 % of datasets available in the PDB have
     an anisotropy equal to or worse than this dataset.


For the resolution shell spanning between 2.07 - 2.00 Angstrom,
the mean I/sigI is equal to  1.34.  4.5 % of these intensities have
an I/sigI > 3. When sorting these intensities by their anisotropic
correction factor and analysing the I/sigI behavior for this ordered
list, we can gauge the presence of 'anisotropy induced noise amplification'
in reciprocal space.

  The quarter of Intensities *least* affected by the anisotropy correction show
    <I/sigI>                 :   1.43e+00
    Fraction of I/sigI > 3   :   5.87e-02     ( Z =     1.54 )

  The quarter of Intensities *most* affected by the anisotropy correction show
    <I/sigI>                 :   1.06e+00
    Fraction of I/sigI > 3   :   2.00e-03     ( Z =     4.61 )

The combined Z-score of     4.86 indicates that there probably is no significant systematic
noise amplification.

Z-scores are computed on the basis of a Bernoulli model assuming independence of weak reflections wrst anisotropy.

------------------------------------------------

 Possible reasons for the presence of the reported
 unexpected low or elevated mean intensity in
 a given resolution bin are :
 - missing overloaded or weak reflections
 - suboptimal data processing
 - satellite (ice) crystals
 - NCS
 - translational pseudo symmetry (detected elsewhere)
 - outliers (detected elsewhere)
 - ice rings (detected elsewhere)
 - other problems
 Note that the presence of abnormalities
 in a certain region of reciprocal space might
 confuse the data validation algorithm throughout
 a large region of reciprocal space, even though
 the data are acceptable in those areas.

Ice ring related problems

 The following statistics were obtained from ice-ring 
 insensitive resolution ranges 
  mean bin z_score      : 3.38
      ( rms deviation   : 2.04 )
  mean bin completeness : 0.99
     ( rms deviation   : 0.01 )

 The following table shows the z-scores 
 and completeness in ice-ring sensitive areas.
 Large z-scores and high completeness in these 
 resolution ranges might be a reason to re-assess
 your data processsing if ice rings were present.

------------------------------------------------
| d_spacing | z_score | compl. | Rel. Ice int. |
------------------------------------------------
|    3.897  |   2.02  |   1.00 |     1.000     |
|    3.669  |   2.41  |   1.00 |     0.750     |

|    2.072  |   3.24  |   1.00 |     0.300     |
------------------------------------------------

 Abnormalities in mean intensity or completeness at
 resolution ranges with a relative ice ring intensity
 lower than 0.10 will be ignored.

 No ice ring related problems detected.
 If ice rings were present, the data does not look
 worse at ice ring related d_spacings as compared
 to the rest of the data set.

 Largest Patterson peak with length larger than 15 Angstrom

 Distance to origin  :   36.518
 Height (origin=100) :    5.514
 p_value(height)     :    8.199e-01


   The reported p_value has the following meaning:
     The probability that a peak of the specified height
     or larger is found in a Patterson function of a
     macro molecule that does not have any translational
     pseudo symmetry is equal to  8.199e-01.
     p_values smaller than 0.05 might indicate
     weak translational pseudo symmetry, or the self vector of
     a large anomalous scatterer such as Hg, whereas values
     smaller than 1e-3 are a very strong indication for
     the presence of translational pseudo symmetry.




Systematic absences
-------------------

The following table gives information about systematic absences.

For each operator, the reflections are split in three classes:

  Absent    : Reflections that are absent for this operator.
  Non Absent: Reflection of the same type (i.e. (0,0,l)) as above, but they should be present.
  Complement: All other reflections.

For each class, the <I/sigI> is reported, as well as the number of
'violations'. A 'violation' is designated as a reflection for which a
I/sigI criterion is not met. The criteria are

  Absent violation     : I/sigI > 3.0
  Non Absent violation : I/sigI < 3.0
  Complement violation : I/sigI < 3.0

Operators with low associated violations for *both* absent and non absent
reflections, are likely to be true screw axis or glide planes. Both the
number of violations and their percentages are given.  The number of
violations within the 'complement' class, can be used as a comparison for
the number of violations in the non-absent class.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Operator | absent under operator  |          | not absent under operator  |              | all other reflections  |          |          |
|          |  <I/sigI> (violations) | n absent |  <I/sigI> (violations)     | n not absent |  <I/sigI> (violations) | n compl  |  Score   |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
| 2_0 (c)  |     0.00  (0,  0.0%)   |        0 |    18.06  (0,  0.0%)       |        9     |    18.28  (382,  6.7%) |     5701 | 1.68e+00 |
| 2_1 (c)  |     0.00  (0,  0.0%)   |        0 |    18.06  (0,  0.0%)       |        9     |    18.28  (382,  6.7%) |     5701 | 1.68e+00 |
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Analyses of the absences table indicates a number of likely space group
candidates, which are listed below. For each space group, the number of
absent violations are listed under the '+++' column. The number of present
violations (weak reflections) are listed under '---'. The last column is a
likelihood based score for the particular space group.  Note that
enantiomorphic spacegroups will have equal scores. Also, if absences were
removed while processing the data, they will be regarded as missing
information, rather then as enforcing that absence in the space group choices.

 L test for acentric data

 using difference vectors (dh,dk,dl) of the form: 
(2hp,2kp,2lp)
  where hp, kp, and lp are random signed integers such that 
  2 <= |dh| + |dk| + |dl| <= 8 

  Mean |L|   :0.458  (untwinned: 0.500; perfect twin: 0.375)
  Mean  L^2  :0.285  (untwinned: 0.333; perfect twin: 0.200)

  The distribution of |L| values indicates a twin fraction of
  0.00. Note that this estimate is not as reliable as obtained
  via a Britton plot or H-test if twin laws are available.

Twinning and intensity statistics summary (acentric data):

Statistics independent of twin laws
  <I^2>/<I>^2 : 1.899  (untwinned: 2.0, perfect twin: 1.5)
  <F>^2/<F^2> : 0.812  (untwinned: 0.785, perfect twin: 0.885)
  <|E^2-1|>   : 0.689  (untwinned: 0.736, perfect twin: 0.541)
  <|L|>, <L^2>: 0.458, 0.285
  Multivariate Z score L-test: 2.306

 The multivariate Z score is a quality measure of the given
 spread in intensities. Good to reasonable data are expected
 to have a Z score lower than 3.5.
 Large values can indicate twinning, but small values do not
 necessarily exclude it.



No (pseudo)merohedral twin laws were found.


Patterson analyses
  - Largest peak height   : 5.514
   (corresponding p value : 0.81986)


The largest off-origin peak in the Patterson function is 5.51% of the 
height of the origin peak. No significant pseudotranslation is detected.

The results of the L-test indicate that the intensity statistics
behave as expected. No twinning is suspected.
